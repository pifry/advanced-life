Multi-Dimmensional version of Conway's Game of Life
===================================================

This is my sandbox for playing with Conway's Game of Life. 
It was created as a weekend project and have some flaws. 
I's very inefficient and lacks few GUI options. Right now 
multiple dimmensions can be acheived only through code 
editing. What I'm particulary proud of is engin kernel 
method that is number of dimmensions independent. Because 
of this, application have great potential.
